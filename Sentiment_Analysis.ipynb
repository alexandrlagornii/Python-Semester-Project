       "[[\" Choose a career. Choose a family.  Choose a fucking big television.  Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, electrical tin openers.  Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance.  Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments.  Choose a starter home.  Choose your friends.  Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.  Choose a three-piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics.  Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.    Choose sitting on that couch  watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows  stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.  Tommy, go!  Choose rotting away at the end of it all,  pissing your last in a miserable home,  nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats  that you've spawned to replace yourself.  Choose your future. Choose life.  But why would I want to do a thing like that?  I chose not to choose life. I chose something else. And the reasons?  There are no reasons.  Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?  Goldfinger is better than Dr. No.    Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds Are Forever.  A judgement reflected in its relatively poor showing at the box office.  And in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.  People think it's all about misery and desperation and death, and all that shite  which is not to be ignored.  Fuck off! Jealous cunt.  But what they forget is the pleasure of it.  They're all dead, right, mate?  You prick!  Otherwise we wouldn't do it.  - Do you want me to do it? - Yeah.  Pure as the driven snow, that shit, Danny.  After all, we're not fucking stupid. Or at least we're not that fucking stupid.  Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand  and you're still nowhere near it.  It beats any meat injection.  That beats any fucking cock in the world.  When you're on junk, you have only one worry, scoring.  When you're off it, you're suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite.  Got no money, can't get drunk. Got money, drinking too much.  Can't get a girl, no chance of a ride. Got a girl, too much hassle.  You have to worry about bills, about food,  about some football team that never fucking wins,  about human relationships, and all the things that really don't matter  when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.  I'd say, in those days, he was a muscular actor.  With all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster,  but combined with a sly wit  to make him a formidable romantic lead  and closer in that respect to Cary Grant.  The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback,  is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you...  No way would I poison my body with that shit.  All them fucking chemicals.  No fucking way.  It's a waste of your life, man, poisoning your body with that shit.  Every chance you've had, Son, you've blown it.  Stuffing your veins with that filth.  From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.  Never again, Swanney. I'm off the skag.  - Are you serious? - Yeah.  - No more. I'm finished with that shite. - Well, that's up to you, man.  Gonna do it right this time,  gonna get it sorted out, get off it for good.  - I'm sure I've heard that one before. - The Sick Boy method.  - It really worked for him, eh? - He's always been lacking in moral fibre.  - He knows a lot about Sean Connery. - That's hardly a substitute.  You need one more hit.  - No, I don't think so. - For the long night that lies ahead.  We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit.  Of course I'd have another shot. After all, I had work to do.  Relinquishing junk. Stage one, preparation.  For this you will need one room, which you will not leave.  Soothing music. Tomato soup, ten tins of.  Mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption cold.  Ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of. Magnesia, milk of, one bottle.  Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins, mineral water, Lucozade,  pornography.  One mattress.  One bucket for urine, one for faeces, and one for vomitus.  One television and one bottle of Valium,  which I've already procured from my mother, who is,  in her own domestic and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict.  Now I'm ready.  All I need is one final hit to soothe the pain  while the Valium ta\",\n",
       "  'kes effect.  Mikey. Aye. Yeah, it\\'s Mark Renton.  Look, I wondered, could you help me out?  This was typical of Mikey Forrester.  What the fuck are these?  Under the normal run of things  I\\'d have nothing to do with the cunt, but this wasn\\'t the normal run of things.  Opium suppositories.  Ideal for your purposes.  Slow release, bring you down gradually.  Custom fucking designed for your needs.  I want a fucking hit.  That\\'s all I\\'ve got, man. Take it or leave it.  Are you feeling better now, then, eh?  Oh, aye. For all the good they\\'ve done me, I might as well have stuck them up my arse.  Heroin makes you constipated.  The heroin from my last hit is fading away, and the suppositories have yet to melt.  I\\'m no longer constipated.  I fantasise about a massive, pristine convenience,  brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from ebony,  a cistern full of Chanel No. 5  and a flunky handing me pieces of raw silk toilet roll.  But under the circumstances, I\\'ll settle for anywhere.  Fuck.  Yes, you fucking dancer!  And now,  now I\\'m ready.  The downside of coming off junk was I knew I\\'d need  to mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness.  It was awful.  They reminded me so much of myself, I could hardly bear to look at them.  Take Sick Boy, for instance. He came off junk at the same time as me  not because he wanted to, you understand, but just to annoy me.  Just to show me how easily he could do it, thereby downgrading my own struggle.  Sneaky fucker, don\\'t you think?  And when all I wanted to do was lie there and feel sorry for myself,  he insisted on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life.  It\\'s certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.  What do you mean?  Well, at one point you\\'ve got it, then you lose it, and it\\'s gone forever,  all walks of life.  Georgie Best, for example, had it, lost it.  Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.  Lou Reed, some of his solo stuff is not bad.  No, it\\'s not bad, but it\\'s not great either, is it?  And in your heart, you kind of know that although it sounds all right,  it\\'s actually just shite.  So, who else?  Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.  Okay, so what\\'s the point you\\'re trying to make?  All I am trying to do, Mark, is to help you understand that The Name of the Rose  is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.  And what about The Untouchables?  I don\\'t rate that at all.  Despite the Academy award?  That means fuck-all. It\\'s a sympathy vote.  So, we all get old, we can\\'t hack it any more and that\\'s it?  Yeah.  That\\'s your theory?  Yeah.  Beautifully fucking illustrated.  Give me the gun.  Give me the gun.  Do you see the beast?  Have you got it in your sights?  Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.  This should present no significant problems.  For a vegetarian, Rents, you\\'re a fucking evil shot.  Without heroin, I attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen.  - Good luck, Spud. - Cheers, cowboy.  - Now remember. - What?  If they think you\\'re not trying, you\\'re in trouble, right?  First hint of that and they\\'ll be on to the DHSS, \"This cunt is not trying.\"  - And your Giro\\'s fucking finished, right? - Right.  - But then again, try too hard... - You might get the fucking job.  - Exactly. - Nightmare.  It\\'s a tightrope, Spud. It\\'s a fucking tightrope.  See, I just get pure shy with the interviewer cats.  I get all nervous and I can\\'t answer any of their questions  like I\\'m a footballer and I get nerves on the big occasion.  Try some of this, Spud.  Yeah, a little dab of speed is just the ticket, man.  No, I went to Craigie, Craignewton.  I just put down Royal Edinburgh College to help get the job.  There\\'s too much discrimination in this town, man.  \\'Cause they\\'re both schools, right?  We\\'re all in this together, and I wanted to put across  the general idea rather than the details. People get all hung up on details.  Like, which school did I go to? How many grades did I get?  Could be six, could be none. It\\'s not important.  What is important is that I am, yes?  Mr Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?  No! Well, yes. Only to get my foot in the door.  Showing initiative and that, like.  But you were referred here by the Department of Employment.  There was no need for ',\n",
       "  'you to get your \"foot in the door\" as you put it.  Yeah, cool. Whatever you say.  Sorry, you\\'re the man, the dude in the chair.  I am merely here. Obviously, I\\'m here.  Mr Murphy, what exactly attracts you to the leisure industry?  In a word, pleasure.  Like, my pleasure in other people\\'s leisure.  Do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?  Oh, yes! \\'Cause I\\'m a bit of a perfectionist, actually. Yes, I am.  See, for me it\\'s got to be the best or it\\'s nothing at all.  Like, if things get a bit dodgy, I just cannot be bothered.  But, hey, I\\'m getting good vibes about this interview thing today, though, man.  Seems to me like it\\'s going pretty well, eh?  Thank you, Mr Murphy.  We\\'ll let you know.  The pleasure was mine, man.  Spud had done well, I was proud of him.  He fucked up good and proper. You had to hand it to Spud.  Picture the scene. The other fucking week there  down the fucking Volley. Me and Tommy playing pool.  I\\'m playing like Paul fucking Newman by the way.  Giving the boy here the tanning of a lifetime.  So it comes to the last shot, the deciding ball of the whole tournament.  I\\'m on the black and he\\'s sat in the corner looking all fucking biscuit-arsed  when this hard cunt comes in, obviously fucking fancied himself.  Starts staring at me,  looking at me, right fucking at me, as if to say, \"Come ahead, square go.\"  You know me. I\\'m not the type of cunt that goes looking for fucking bother  but at the end of the day I\\'m the cunt with the pool cue  and he can get the fat end in his puss any time he fucking wanted, like.  So I squares up, casual like.  What does the hard cunt do?  Or the so-called hard cunt. Shites it,  puts down his drink, turns and gets the fuck out of there, and after that,  well, the game was mine.  And that was it.  That was Begbie\\'s story. Or at least that was Begbie\\'s version of the story.  But a couple of days later I got the truth from Tommy.  You always got the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses.  He never told lies, he never took drugs, and he never cheated on anyone.  It was Wednesday morning. We were in the Volley playing pool, that much is true.  But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash.  He\\'s got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue,  never mind pot a ball.  I\\'m doing my best to lose, you know, trying to humour him, like.  But it\\'s not doing any good.  Every time I touch a ball, I seem to pot something.  Every time Begbie goes near the table, he fucks it up.  Oh, fuck\\'s sake.  So, he\\'s got the hump, right?  But, finally, I managed to set it up so all he has to do is to pot the black  to win one game, to salvage a little bit of pride  and maybe not kick my head in, right?  So, he\\'s on the black, pressure shot.  Then it all goes wrong, big time.  Fuck!  He picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar  and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him.  I couldn\\'t believe it.  The poor wee cunt hasn\\'t even glanced in our direction.  Fuck off!  He was going to chib him, I tell you.  Then I thought he was going to do me.  The beggar is fucking psycho, man.  But he\\'s a mate, you know. So what can you do?  Can I borrow this?  What indeed could one do?  Just stand back and watch, and try not to get involved?  Begbie didn\\'t do drugs either.  He just did people, that\\'s what he got off on.  His own sensory addiction.  That lassie got glassed and no cunt leaves here till we find out what cunt did it.  Who the fuck are you?  Oh, Tom.  - Oh, Lizzy, it\\'s so good. - Oh, Tom, I\\'m coming.  As I sat watching the intimate and highly personal video  stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends,  I realised that something important was missing from my life.  - I read it in Cosmopolitan. - It\\'s an interesting theory.  Actually, it\\'s a nightmare.  I\\'ve been desperate for a shag  but watching him suffer was just too much fun.  You should try it with Tommy.  What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him?  Did I tell you about my birthday?  - No, what happened? - He forgot. Useless motherfucker.  Did she go ballistic?  Big-time. Absolutely fucking right. \"It\\'s me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.\"  What are you two talking about?  Football.  What are you talking about?  Shopping.  The situation was becoming serious.  Young Renton noticed the haste with whic',\n",
       "  'h the successful  in the sexual sphere, as in all others, segregated themselves from the failures.  Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive, but now it returned with a vengeance.  And as the impotence of those days faded into memory,  grim desperation took a hold in his sex-crazed mind.  His post-junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine  taunted him remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire.  Dot, dot, dot.  And with that, Mark Renton had fallen in love.  Excuse me, excuse me. I don\\'t mean to harass you, but I was very impressed  with your capable and stylish manner of dealing with that situation.  I was thinking to myself, \"Now, this girl\\'s special.\"  Thanks.  - What\\'s your name? - Diane.  - Where are you going, Diane? - I\\'m going home.  - Where\\'s that? - It\\'s where I live.  Great.  What?  I\\'ll come back with you if you like, but I\\'m not promising anything.  Do you find that this approach usually works?  Or let me guess, you\\'ve never tried it before.  In fact, you don\\'t normally approach girls, am I right?  The truth is that you\\'re a quiet, sensitive type  but if I\\'m prepared to take a chance, I might just get to know the inner you.  Witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal.  Taxi!  A little bit crazy, a little bit bad. But, hey,  don\\'t us girls just love that?  Eh?  Well, what\\'s wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue?  I left something...  Are you getting in or not, pal?  Do you understand? I expect you to be a considerate and thoughtful lover.  - Generous but firm. - What?  Failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations  will result in swift resumption of a non-sex situation.  Right?  Diane?  - What? - Shut up!  Wake up, Spud.  Wake up.  Sex.  Casual sex.  Tommy, let\\'s put the tape on.  Now?  I want to watch ourselves while we\\'re screwing.  So, let\\'s see what I\\'m missing.  Not much.  There\\'s the captain, Archie Gemmill,  picking it up from the outside.  I think he wants to go himself. Is he gonna go?  He\\'s going all the way. And he scores!  What a magnificent goal!  Gemmill at his very best.  What a penetrating goal that was!  I haven\\'t felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.  Right.  You can\\'t sleep here.  - What? - Out.  Come on.  No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the hall or go home, it\\'s up to you.  And don\\'t make any noise.  Jesus.  What do you mean, \"It\\'s gone\"? Where has it gone, Tommy?  It\\'ll be here somewhere.  - I might have returned it by mistake. - Returned it?  Where? The video shop, Tommy?  The fucking video shop?  So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video?  God, Tommy, I feel sick.  - Hi. - Hello.  Fuck.  Come in and sit down.  Like some coffee?  Aye.  - You must be Mark. - Aye, that\\'s me.  - Are you a friend of Diane\\'s? - More a friend of a friend, no?  Right.  Are you her flatmates, like?  Flatmates?  I must remember that one.  Morning.  - Good morning, Spud. - Morning, Gail.  Mr Houston. Mrs Houston.  Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.  Sorry about last night, by the way.  That\\'s all right. I slept fine on the sofa.  I had a bit much to drink, had a bit of an accident.  Don\\'t worry, son. These things happen.  Does a man good to cut loose once in a while.  This one could do with being tied up once in a while.  - I\\'ll put the sheets in the machine now. - No, I\\'ll wash them.  - There\\'s no need. - No, it\\'s no problem.  It\\'s no problem for me, either.  - I\\'d rather take care of it myself, actually. - Honestly, it\\'s no problem.  - Really, no! - Spud, they\\'re my sheets.  - I don\\'t see why not. - Because it\\'s illegal, that\\'s why not.  - What, holding hands? - No, not holding hands.  In that case you can do it.  You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.  Yeah, and that\\'s what\\'s illegal.  Do you know what they do to people like me inside?  They cut your balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.  - Calm down. You\\'re not going to jail. - That\\'s very easy for you to say, Diane.  - Can I see you again? - Certainly not.  If you don\\'t see me again, I\\'ll tell the police.  I\\'ll see you around then.  Now what?  We go for a walk.  - What? - A walk.  - Where? - There.  Are you serious?  What are you waiting for?  Hey, Tommy.  This is not natural, man.  It\\'s the great outdoors.  It\\'s fresh air.  Look, Tommy, we know',\n",
       "  ' you\\'re getting a hard time off Lizzy  but there\\'s really no need to take it out on us.  - Doesn\\'t it make you proud to be Scottish? - It\\'s shite being Scottish.  We\\'re the lowest of the low. The scum of the fucking earth.  The most wretched, miserable, servile, pathetic trash  that was ever shat into civilisation.  Some people hate the English, I don\\'t. They\\'re just wankers.  We, on the other hand, are colonised by wankers.  Can\\'t even find a decent culture to be colonised by.  We\\'re ruled by effete arseholes.  It\\'s a shite state of affairs to be in, Tommy.  And all the fresh air in the world won\\'t make any fucking difference.  Sorry, man. Sorry. No, I\\'m sorry.  I appreciate it, Tommy.  At or around this time,  Spud, Sick Boy and I made a healthy, informed, democratic decision  to get back on heroin as soon as possible.  Took about 12 hours.  It looks easy this, but it\\'s not.  It looks like a doss, like a soft option  but living like this, it\\'s a full-time business.  Ursula Andress, the quintessential Bond girl.  That\\'s what everyone says.  The embodiment, right, of his superiority to us.  Beautiful, exotic, highly sexual,  yet totally unavailable to anyone apart from him.  Shite. I mean, let\\'s face it, mate.  She\\'d shag one punter from Edinburgh, she\\'d shag the whole fucking lot of us.  Yep, I knew he was going to do that.  Lizzy\\'s gone, Mark. She\\'s gone and fucking dumped me.  It was that videotape.  And that Iggy Pop business and all other sorts of shit.  She told me where to go and no fucking mistake.  I said to her, I said,  \"Is there any chance of getting back together?\"  But no fucking way.  Honor Blackman, a.k.a. Pussy Galore, right?  What a total fucking misnomer.  I mean, I wouldn\\'t touch her with yours.  I want to try it, Mark.  You\\'re always going on about how it\\'s like the ultimate hit and that.  Better than sex.  Come on, man, I\\'m a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.  I\\'ve got the money.  Personality, I mean, that\\'s what counts, right?  Personality, I mean, that\\'s what keeps a relationship going through the years.  Like heroin.  I mean,  heroin\\'s got great fucking personality.  Swanney taught us to adore and respect the National Health Service,  for it was the source of much of our gear.  We stole drugs, we stole prescriptions or bought them,  sold them, swapped them, forged them, photocopied them.  Or traded drugs with cancer victims, alcoholics, old-age pensioners,  AIDS patients, epileptics and bored housewives.  We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclizine, codeine, temazepam,  nitrezepam, phenobarbitone and sodium amytal,  dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine,  buprenorphine, dextromoramide, chlormethiazole.  The streets are awash with drugs you can have for unhappiness and pain  and we took them all.  Fuck it, we would have injected vitamin C if only they\\'d made it illegal.  Pardon me, may I use your bathroom? Thank you.  Stop, psycho.  Rent-boy. No fucking smack.  But the good times couldn\\'t last forever.  I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn\\'t really registered before.  She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew.  It\\'d been days since I heard anyone speak.  Surely someone must\\'ve said something in all that time.  Surely to fuck someone must have.  - Allison! - Help me, please!  Calm down.  Everyone\\'s going to be just fine.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  In point of fact, nothing was going to be just fine.  On the contrary, everything was going to be bad.  Bad, I mean, everything was going to be even worse than it already was.  My God! No, my God!  Fuck!  Please, please!  It wasn\\'t my baby. She wasn\\'t my baby. Baby Dawn, she wasn\\'t mine.  Spud\\'s, Swanney\\'s, Sick Boy\\'s, I don\\'t know.  Maybe Allison knew, maybe not.  I wished I could think of something to say. Something sympathetic.  Something human.  Say something, Mark.  Fucking say something, huh?  I\\'m cooking up.  Cook us up a shot, Rents. I really need a hit.  So she did, I could understand that,  to take the pain away.  So I cooked up and she got a hit.  But only after me, that went without saying.  Well, at least we knew who the father was now.  It wasn\\'t just the baby that died that day.  Something inside Sick Boy was lost and never returned.  It seemed he had no theor',\n",
       "  \"y with which to explain a moment like this.  Nor did I.  Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything.  Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile.  Then squirt it into a stinking, purulent vein and do it all over again.  Keep on going, getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over.  Propelling ourselves with longing towards the day that it would all go wrong.  Because no matter how much you stash  or how much you steal, you never have enough.  No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over,  you always need to get up and do it all over again.  Sooner or later this kind of thing was bound to happen.  Because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime,  and despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime.  Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them.  Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret and remorse.  I'm sentencing you to six months' imprisonment.  My only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again.  Mr Renton, I understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilitation  in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin.  The suspension of your sentence  is conditional on your continued co-operation with this programme.  Should you stand guilty before me again,  I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.  Thank you, Your Honour.  With God's help, I'll conquer this terrible affliction.  What can you say?  Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.  It was fucking obvious that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.  Hope you've learned your lesson, Son.  My son, I thought I was going to lose you there.  You're nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.  You'd better clean up your fucking act, sunshine. Cut that shite out forever.  Listen to Francis, Mark. He's talking sense, kid.  Fucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days.  There are better things than the needle, Rents. Choose life.  I remember when you were a wee baby.  ♪Mama's little baby♪  ♪loves shortening, shortening♪  ♪Mama's little baby loves shortening bread♪  I'm sorry, Mrs Murphy.  It was not fair, Spud going down and not me.  Well, it's not our fault.  Your boy went down because he was a fucking smack-head.  If that's not your fault, then I don't know what is.  I was the fucking cunt that tried to get him off it.  - I'll get the fucking drinks then, eh? - Aye.  I wished I'd gone down instead of Spud.  Here I was, surrounded by my family and my so-called mates  and I've never felt so alone. Never in all my puff.  Since I was on remand, they've had me on this programme,  the state-sponsored addiction,  three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack.  But it's never enough.  And at the moment, it's nowhere near enough.  I took all three this morning and now I've got 18 hours to go till my next shot  and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost.  I need to visit the Mother Superior for one hit.  One fucking hit  to get us over this long, hard day.  - What's on the menu this evening, sir? - Your favourite dish.  Excellent.  - Usual table, sir? - Why, thank you.  Would sir care to pay for his bill in advance?  No, stick it on my tab.  I regret to inform, sir,  credit limit was reached and breached quite some time ago.  Well, in that case...  Hard currency, that'll do nicely.  Can't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we, sir?  Would sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread, perhaps?  No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.  As you wish, sir. As you wish.  Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?  Open your eyes.  Wake up. Come on. Wake up.  I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the mail, that's for sure.  I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment.  Too ill to sleep.  Too tired to stay awake.  But the sickness is on its way.  Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving.  A need like nothing else I've ever known will soon take hold of me.  It's on its way.  ♪Oh, you've got green eyes♪ ♪Oh, you've got blue eyes♪  ♪Oh, you've got Grey eyes♪  ♪And I've never seen anyone quite like you before♪  ♪No, I've never met anyone quite like you before♪  We'll help you, Son.

       "  ' better.  We\\'re going to beat this together.  Maybe I should go back to the clinic.  No! No clinics. No methadone.  That only made you worse, you said so yourself.  You lied to us, Son, your own mother and father.  - You could bring us some jellies. - No!  You\\'re worse coming off that than you are with the heroin.  - Nothing at all! - It\\'s a clean break this time.  You\\'re staying here where we can keep an eye on you.  I appreciate what you\\'re trying to do, I really do,  but I just need one more score. Just bring me one more hit, please.  I need one more fucking hit!  You fuck!  Hit. Hit.  Well, this is a good fucking laugh, ain\\'t it?  You sweat that shite out of your system because if I come back and it\\'s still here,  I\\'ll fucking kick it out.  Okay.  God!  Question number one. The human immunodeficiency virus is a...  - Retrovirus? - Retrovirus is the right answer.  It\\'s a mug\\'s game, Mrs Renton.  I mean, I\\'m not saying I was blameless myself, far from it, but  there comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense  and just say no.  Just say no.  Oh, my God, she\\'s dead.  Question number two.  HIV binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte?  Which receptor is that?  CD4.  CD4 is the right answer.  Better than sex, Rents. Better than sex.  The ultimate hit.  I\\'m a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.  Well, I\\'m finding out, all right.  Tommy.  No!  Is he guilty? Or not guilty?  He\\'s our son.  Don\\'t! Dawn!  Dawn! Stop!  No!  No! Don\\'t do this to me!  Stop!  Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  There\\'s something you need to do.  Ow!  Come alive, 35.  Box of tricks, 66.  Mark!  Mark, you\\'ve got a house.  House, house!  For goodness\\' sake, Mark.  It seems, however, I really am the luckiest guy in the world.  Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic,  surrounded by the living dead.  But not me. I\\'m negative.  It\\'s official.  And once the pain goes away, that\\'s when the real battle starts.  Depression, boredom.  You feel so fucking low, you want to fucking top yourself.  Tommy.  Tommy!  Tommy, it\\'s Mark, man.  You all right, mate?  - Getting out much, Tommy? - No.  - Following the game at all? - No.  No, me neither, really.  You take the test?  Aye.  Clear?  Aye.  That\\'s nice.  I\\'m sorry, Tommy.  Got any gear on you?  No, I\\'m clean, man.  Well, sub us then, mate.  I\\'m expecting a rent cheque.  Thanks, Mark.  No bother.  No bother. None at all. Not for me, anyway.  Still, it\\'s easy to be philosophical  when it\\'s some other poor cunt with shite for blood.  What do you want?  - Are you clean? - Yes.  - Is that a promise then? - Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.  Calm down, I\\'m only asking.  - Is that hash I can smell? - No.  - I wouldn\\'t mind a bit if it is. - Well, it isn\\'t.  - It smells like it. - You\\'re too young.  I\\'m too young for what?  You\\'re not getting any younger, Mark.  The world\\'s changing, music\\'s changing, even drugs are changing.  You can\\'t stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.  It\\'s Iggy Pop.  Whatever. I mean, the guy\\'s dead anyway.  Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.  The point is, you\\'ve got to find something new.  She was right. I had to find something new.  There was only one thing for it.  Lifestyle Letting Agency.  Yes. It\\'s a beautifully converted Victorian town house.  Ideally located in a quiet road near to the local shops and transport.  This one\\'s two bedrooms and a kitchen/diner.  Fully fitted, in excellent decorative order.  Lots of storage space.  All mod cons and it\\'s going at £320 a week.  I settled in not too badly and kept myself to myself.  Sometimes, of course, I thought about the guys,  but mainly I didn\\'t miss them at all.  After all, this was boomtown,  where any fool could make cash from chaos, and plenty did.  Tell you what I\\'ve got.  I\\'ve got a beautifully converted Victorian town house.  I quite enjoyed the sound of it all.  Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting, sub-letting, sub-dividing,  cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking away.  Who\\'s got the keys to Talgarth Road?  There was no such thing as society.  And even if there was, I most certainly had nothing to do with it.  For the first time in my adult life I was almost content.  \"Dear Mark, I\\'m glad you found a job and somewhere to live.  \"School ',\n",
       "  'is fine at the moment. I\\'m not pregnant, but thanks for asking.  \"Your friend Sick Boy asked me last week if I would like to work for him.  \"But I told him where to go.  \"I met Spud who sends his regards. Or at least I think that\\'s what he said.  \"No one has seen Tommy for ages.  \"And finally, Francis Begbie has been on television a lot this week,  \"as he is wanted by the police in connection with an armed robbery  \"in a jeweller\\'s in Corstorphine.  \"Take care. Yours, with love, Diane.\"  Francis Begbie.  Oh, no.  Armed robbery?  What, with a replica?  How the fuck can it be armed robbery with a fucking replica?  Fucking scandal. And the gear... Look.  Supposed to be fucking solid silver, it\\'s fucking garbage.  Those young couples investing all their fucking hopes in that stuff and all.  - It\\'s a scandal, Franco. - Too fucking right it is.  How about one of these Pot Noodles by the way?  I\\'m fucking Lee Marvin.  Hey, Rents.  Begbie settled in, in no time at all.  I\\'ve got no fucking cigarettes.  Aye, right.  It\\'s me.  Rents.  Yeah, the guy\\'s a psycho.  But it\\'s true, he\\'s a mate and all, so what can you do?  Hey. Pop down the bookies and put a line on for us.  Can you not go yourself?  Well, seeing as how I\\'m a fugitive from the law  and I can\\'t even walk the fucking streets, you go.  Here.  Doncaster. 4:40. £5 to win. Bad Boy.  Buy some fucking beer and all.  Come on, Bad Boy. Come on, son. Come on, son.  Come on. Come on. Yeah!  Yeah.  Bad Boy.  Came in at 16-to-1.  And with the winnings, we went out to celebrate.  Diane was right. The world is changing.  Music is changing, drugs are changing, even men and women are changing.  1,000 years from now, there\\'ll be no guys and no girls, just wankers.  Sounds great to me.  It\\'s just a pity no one told Begbie.  Fuck! Fuck!  You see, if you ask me, we\\'re heterosexual by default,  not by decision.  It\\'s just a question of who you fancy.  It\\'s all about aesthetics and it\\'s fuck-all to do with morality.  Fuck!  But you try telling Begbie that.  Look, I\\'m not a fucking buftie and that\\'s the end of it.  Let\\'s face it, it could have been wonderful.  Fucking listen to me, you piece of junkie shit.  A joke\\'s a fucking joke, you mention that again and I\\'ll cut you up.  You understand?  Since I last saw him,  Sick Boy had reinvented himself as a pimp and a pusher  and was here, he said, to mix business and pleasure,  setting up contacts, as he constantly informed me,  for the great smack deal that was one day going to make him rich.  Good chips.  I can\\'t believe you did that.  I got a good price for it.  Rents, I need the money.  It was my fucking telly.  Christ, if I\\'d known you were going to get so Humpty about it, I wouldn\\'t have bothered.  Fucking rented anyway.  Are you going to eat that?  - Have you got a passport? - Why?  I met this bloke who runs a hotel, brothel.  Loads of contacts.  He does a nice sideline in punting British passports to foreigners.  Get you a good price.  And why would I want to sell my passport?  It was just an idea.  I had to get rid of them.  Sick Boy didn\\'t do his drug deal and he didn\\'t get rich.  Instead, he and Begbie just hung around my bed-sit looking for things to steal.  I decided to offer them one of London\\'s most desirable properties.  But, of course, they weren\\'t paying any rent.  So when my boss found two desperate suckers who would,  Sick Boy and Begbie were bound to feel threatened.  Yep. Lots of storage. All mod cons, 320 quid a week.  And that was that.  But by then we had another reason to go back.  Tommy.  Tommy knew he\\'d got the virus, like, but he never knew he\\'d gone full-blown.  What was it, pneumonia or cancer?  No, toxoplasmosis. It\\'s like a stroke.  How\\'s that?  He wanted to see Lizzy again.  She would not let him near the house.  So he bought her a present. He brought her this kitten.  But Lizzy told him where to fucking stick it?  Exactly.  \"I\\'m not wanting a cat,\" she says, \"Get to fuck, right.\"  So there\\'s Tommy, stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened.  To those of us gathered here today,  Thomas McKenzie filled a number of different roles in our lives.  Thomas was a son...  The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place.  Tommy was lying about, fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers.  He never ',\n",
       "  \"knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.  ...a loving man who had a great lust for life.  - Neither did I. What is it? - Fucking horrible.  - It's like an abscess in your brain. - Fucking hell!  Then what happened?  He starts getting these headaches, so he just uses more smack, for the pain.  And then he has a stroke. A fucking stroke.  Just like that.  He gets home from the hospital and dies three weeks later.  He'd been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the smell  and got the police to break down the door.  Tommy was lying face down in a pool of vomit.  He has gone from us, but we have many things to remember him by.  The kitten was fine.

Did you tell him yet?  On you go.  What?  There's this mate of Swanney's. You know the guy, Mikey Forrester.  Aye.  He's come into some gear.  - A lot of gear. - How much gear?  About two kilos. So he tells me.  He got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week  where he met two Russian sailors.  They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like.  So, he wakes up next morning, realises what he's done,  gets very fucking nervous. He wants rid of this, right?  So?  So, he met me,  and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price  with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.  We've just come back from Tommy's funeral  and you're talking about a skag deal?  Aye.  What was your price?  - Four grand. - You haven't got four grand.  - We're 2,000 short. - Well, that's tough.  Look, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.  I'm sorry, boys, I do not have two grand.  Aye, you fucking do.  I've seen your bank statement.  For fuck's sake.  £2,133.  Two kilos. What is that, ten years?  Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors, what the fuck are you boys on?  Spud, you've already been to jail.  What's the deal? You like it so much, you want to go back?  I just want the money, Mark.  If everybody keeps their fucking mouth shut, there'll be no cunt going to jail.  I hadn't told anyone everything that was running through my mind  about what might happen in London.  There were a lot of possibilities I didn't want to talk to anyone about.  Ideas best kept to myself.  What no one told me was that when we bought the smack,  some lucky punter would have to try it out.  Begbie didn't trust Spud. Sick Boy was too careful these days.  So I rolled up my sleeve, I spiked my vein, and I did what had to be done.  It's good. Oh, it's really fucking good.  Yeah, that hit was good.  I promised myself another one before we got to London.  Just the one hit, just for old times' sake. Just to piss Begbie off.  This was his nightmare.  The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgy scams,  being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuckups in town.  I knew what was going on in his mind.  Any trouble in London, and he would dump us immediately.  One way or another, he had to.  If he got caught with a bag full of smack on top of that armed robbery shit,  he was going down for 15 to 20.  Begbie was hard. But not so hard that he didn't shite it off 20 years in prison.  This was to be my final hit.  But let's be clear about this. There's final hits and final hits.  What kind was this to be?  - Did you bring the cards? - What?  The cards, the last thing I told you was to mind the cards.  I've not brought them.  It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.  I'm sorry.  - Bit fucking late. - Why didn't you bring them?  'Cause I fucking told you to bring them, you doss cunt!  Christ.  These are your friends, right?  These are the guys I told you about.  Okay.  - Well, is he here? - Yeah, he's here.  You didn't get followed or nothing, did you?  We didn't get followed.  Okay.  - All right. - Hi.  Straightaway he clocked us for what we were.  Small-time wasters with an accidental big deal.  Excuse me, gentlemen.  So, how much would you like for this?  20,000\",\n",
       "  \".  I don't think it's worth much more than 15.  This was a real drag to him. He didn't need to negotiate.  What the fuck were we going to do with it if he didn't buy it?  Sell it on the streets? Fuck that.  - Well, 19. - Terribly sorry, I can't go to 19.  Well, fucking 16 then.  Okay. Well, fucking 16 it is then.  These, gentlemen, are £2,000 bundles.  That's two.  That's four.  We settled on £16,000.  He had a lot more in the suitcase, but it was better than nothing.  ...make eight.  Thank you very much, gentlemen.  I'd just like to say it's been a pleasure haggling with you.  Fucking brand new, by the way.  Okay?  Yes!  Fucking...  And just for a moment it felt really great.  Like we were all in it together, like friends, like it meant something.  A moment like that, it can touch you deep inside.  But it doesn't last long. Not like £16,000.  So, what about you, Spud?  Any major investments on the horizon at all?  Going to buy yourself a wee island in the sun?  What, for four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks and a fucking sewage outflow.  I don't know, man.  I'm going to get something for my ma, I think.  Get some good speed, no bicarb.  Then get a girl, take her out, treat her right.  - And shag her senseless? - No, man, true love. True love.  But I could really handle some hot sex with a Jewish princess tonight.  - You daft cunt. - Or a Catholic.  If you're going to waste it on a bird, you might as well fucking leave it all to me.  - Now get the drinks in. - I got a round already.  - I got the last one. - It's your round, Franco.  Okay. Same again?  Right.  I'm off for a piss.  See when I get back that money's still here, okay?  The moment your back's turned we're out the door.  - Yeah? I'll be right fucking after you. - You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard.  By the way, see, when I get back...  We'll be halfway down the street with the money.  - I'd fucking kill you. - I thought you might, Franco.  Thought you might.  Are you game for it?  What?  Well?  Are you serious?  I don't know. What do you think?  - Still here, I see. - Aye. We wouldn't run out on a mate.  Why not? I know I would.  Where's Franco?  - For fuck's sake! - Sorry, mate. I'll buy you another one.  You've ruined my fucking suit, you fucking idiots.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.  Sorry is not going to dry me off, you cunt.  Cool down, Franco. The man says he's sorry.  Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.  Fuck you.  If you can't hold a pint you shouldn't be in the pub, mate. Now, fuck off.  No, Frank, not that, man.  Oh, fuck's sake.  - Fucking nice one, Franco. - Shut it.  - You cut me, man. - You were in my fucking way.  Help!  Anybody else want to get in my fucking way?  You?  You?  Hey, Rent-boy.  You bring me down a fucking smoke.  - I think we'd better go, Franco. - I've got to go to the hospital, man.  You're not going to any fucking hospital. You're staying there.  You bring me down a fucking cigarette.  And the bag.  Now I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways.  It wasn't a big deal, just a minor betrayal.  Or we'd outgrown each other, you know, that sort of thing.  But let's face it, I ripped them off, my so-called mates.  But, Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about him.  And Sick Boy would have done the same to me if he'd only thought of it first.  And Spud, okay, I felt sorry for Spud. He never hurt anybody.  Bastard!  Bastard!  Right. Move away, everybody.  What's going on in there?  Open up. Open up now!  Bastard!  So, why did I do it?  I could offer a million answers, all false.  The truth is that I'm a bad person.  But that is going to change. I'm going to change.  This is the last of that sort of thing.  Now I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life.  I'm looking forward to it already.  I'm going to be just like you.  The job, the family, the fucking big television.

Nice to meet you too.  - So you wanna take me out. - I would love to take you out.  - Where do you wanna go? - Pizza.  - Pi',\n",
       "  'zza. - Yeah.  - I like pizza. - Yeah, I know this great pizza place.  Cool. Okay, well...  I get off at 7 on Monday.  - Okay. - You wanna meet here?  - Okay. Yeah. I will. - Yeah.  Great.  Okay. Seven o\\'clock?  - Here. - At 7 p. m.  - Monday. Andrew. - All right.  - Bye. - Bye.  It\\'s not that bad. She\\'s a go-go dancer. Could\\'ve did porn, she chose not to.  - That make it better? - Yeah, little bit.  - That\\'s classier. - I can deal with that.  Bitch had a foot fetish or something.  - This is good. - You get on that?  That\\'s it.  You are fucking kidding me.  - You the new alternate? - Yeah. I\\'m Andrew Neiman.  Tune the set to B-flat, then turn my pages.  Sure.  Excuse me. Could I get a B-flat?  Thank you.  Sorry. Can you...? Just one more time?  That\\'s a great kit.  I play the new cymbals now.  Milk the cunt!  We got a squeaker today, people. Neiman.  Nineteen years old. Isn\\'t he cute?  All right, gang, \"Whiplash.\"  Page. Page!  Barker, that is not your boyfriend\\'s dick. Do not come early.  Bar 93.  Five, six, and...  Stop.  Now, this one really upsets me. We have an out-of-tune player here.  Before I continue, would that player care to identify himself?  No?  Okay, maybe a bug flew in my ear.  One-fifteen.  Five, six, and...  No. My ears are fine.  We definitely have an out-of-tune player.  Whoever it is, this is your last chance.  And there it went.  Now, either you are deliberately playing out of tune...  ...and sabotaging my band...  ...or you don\\'t know you\\'re out of tune...  ...which I\\'m afraid is even worse.  Reeds.  Five, six, and...  Bones.  Five, six, and...  He\\'s here.  Tell me it\\'s not you, Elmer Fudd.  It\\'s okay. Play.  Do you think you\\'re out of tune?  There\\'s no fucking Mars bar down there. What are you looking at?  Look up here. Look at me.  Do you think you\\'re out of tune?  Yes.  Then why the fuck didn\\'t you say so?  I\\'ve carried your fat ass for too long.  I won\\'t have you cost us a competition...  ...because your mind\\'s on a Happy Meal instead of on pitch.  Jackson, congratulations, you\\'re fourth chair.  Metz, why are you still sitting there? Get the fuck out!  For the record, Metz wasn\\'t out of tune. You were, Erickson.  But he didn\\'t know...  ...and that\\'s bad enough.  All right, take 10. When we get back, the squeaker\\'s on.  Two, two, three. Two, two, three.  If he put half the effort into playing the trombone...  Andrew.  - Parents musicians? - No.  - What do they do? - My dad\\'s a writer.  What\\'s he written?  I guess he\\'s more of a teacher, really.  - College? - Pennington High School.  - Your mother, what does she do? - I don\\'t know. She left when I was a baby.  No musicians in the family?  You just gotta listen to the greats, then.  Buddy Rich, Jo Jones...  You know, Charlie Parker became Bird...  ...because Jones threw a cymbal at his head.  See what I\\'m saying?  Listen, the key is to just relax.  Don\\'t worry about the numbers.  Don\\'t worry about what other guys are thinking.  You\\'re here for a reason.  You believe that, right?  Yeah.  Say it.  I\\'m here for a reason.  Cool.  All right, man. Have fun.  All right, gang, \"Whiplash.\"  A little under tempo, okay? Neiman, just do your best.  Here we go.  Five, six, and...  Let\\'s hear some fills.  We got Buddy Rich here.  A little trouble there. Just pick it up at 17.  Ready?  Five, six, and...  Not quite my tempo.  Here we go. ',\n",

Here we go.  Five, six, seven...  You\\'re rushing. Here we go.  Five... Ready? Okay.  Five, six, and...  Dragging just a hair.  Wait for my cue.  Five, six, seven...  Rushing. Five, six, and...  Dragging. Five, six, and...  Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head, Neiman?  - I don\\'t know. - Sure you do.  - The tempo? - Were you rushing or dragging?  I don\\'t know.  - Start. - Five, six, seven...  In four, damn it. Look at me.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four. One, two, three...  Now, was I rushing or was I dragging?  - I don\\'t know. - Count again.  One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.  - One, two, three, four. - Rushing or dragging?  - Rushing. - So you do know the difference.  If you deliberately sabotage my band...  ...I will fuck you like a pig.  Now, are you a rusher...  ...or are you a dragger...  ...or are you gonna be on my fucking time?  I\\'m gonna be on your time.  - What does that say? - \"Quarter note equals 215.\"  - Count me a 215. - One, two, three, four.  - One, two, three, four. - Jesus Christ.  I didn\\'t know they allowed retards.  Am I to understand that you cannot read tempo?  - Can you even read music? What\\'s that? - Eighth note.  - Yes. What is that? - Dotted 16th note.  Sight-read measure 101.  What, are you in a fucking a Capella group? Play the goddamn kit.  Stop. Now answer my question.  Were you rushing or were you dragging?  - Answer! - Rushing.  Oh, my dear God.  Are you one of those single-tear people?  Do I look like a double fucking rainbow to you? You must be upset.  - Are you upset? - No.  No? So you just don\\'t give a shit?  - I do give a shit. - So are you upset? Yes or fucking no?  Yes, you are upset.  Yeah.  - Say it. - I\\'m upset.  Say it so the whole band can hear you.  - I\\'m upset. - Louder.  - I\\'m upset. - Louder!  I\\'m upset.  You are a worthless, friendless, faggot-lipped piece of shit...  ...whose Mommy left Daddy when she figured out he wasn\\'t Eugene O\\'Neill.  Who\\'s now weeping and slobbering all over my drum set...  ...like a fucking 9-year-old girl.  So for the final father-fucking time...  - ...say it louder! - I\\'m upset!  Carl.  Start practising harder, Neiman.  \"Whiplash,\" bar 125.  Big-boy tempo.  Five, six, and...  This place is nice.  Yeah. I really like the music that they play.  - I mean, the food\\'s good too, but... - No, the pizza\\'s really good.  \"When I Wake.\"  - What? - That\\'s the name of the song.  Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938.  Bob Ellis on the drums.  Every time I saw you at the theater, your eyes were glued to the floor.  Really?  My dad says that I have... I have trouble making eye contact.  My parents like to criticise me too.  Growing up, my mom said I had a really big chin...  ...that\\'s why guys wouldn\\'t like me.  - Really? You don\\'t. - Yeah.  Well, she said my dad cursed me with one.  It\\'s like Jay Leno. Look.  - No, it\\'s not. - Yeah, it is.  - I don\\'t... I don\\'t think so at all. - Well, that\\'s nice.  Your chin\\'s very nice. Very nice.  Your mom sounds insane.  She did wanna be an actress when she was my age.  - What about you? - What about me?  What do you do?  I go to Fordham.  What do you study?  I don\\'t have a major yet.  - B',\n",
       "  'ut, like, what do you want to study? - I don\\'t really know.  I don\\'t know yet.  So Fordham was just like a random school?  No, I applied to a bunch of schools, Fordham let me in.  Why\\'d you pick Shaffer?  It\\'s the best music school in the country.  Well, Fordham was Fordham.  I don\\'t love it there, to be honest.  - No? - No.  I...  I don\\'t know. I guess it\\'s just the people. I don\\'t know if they like me very much.  I\\'m from Arizona, and I think they can see it.  - I feel the same about people at Shaffer. - Yeah?  Yeah. I don\\'t think they like me too much.  But I don\\'t... I don\\'t...  I don\\'t care too much. I think it just... It changes.  You know, people change and things work out.  No, no, I know, I know.  I just...  I feel really homesick sometimes.  I don\\'t know.  It kind of pisses me off when people pretend like they\\'re not.  In college, you know?  Maybe I\\'m literally the only one, I don\\'t know.  I still go to the movies with my dad.  - Hey. How are you, man? - Good to see you.  And please, is this really Eva?  Last time I saw you, you were very tiny.  Are you playing an instrument yet?  She started piano last week.  When you\\'re a big college kid, will you come play in my band?  - Would you like that? - Be my piano player?  Excellent. Give me five, baby.  - All right. Great to see you. - Great seeing you.  - See you after the show. - Absolutely.  Cheers.  Listen up, Cocksuckers.  Hurry the fuck up. Get your music.  \"Irene\" only. Set one. Rhythm section out first.  The kit is a fucking tonal catastrophe. Get it in tune, all right?  Rhythm and soloists, bar 45.  We\\'re gonna pick up the tempo.  Bar 106, brass, do not forget we sharp that ninth.  Everybody remember, Lincoln Center use these competitions...  ...to decide who they\\'re interested in and who they\\'re not.  I\\'m not gonna have my reputation in that department tarnished...  ...by a bunch of limp-dick, sour-note...  ...flatter-than-their-girlfriends, flexible-tempo dipshits.  One more thing. Give me that.  If I ever find one of these lying around again...  ...I swear to fucking God, I will stop being so polite.  Get the fuck out of my sight before I demolish you.  Stage right, in order, now.  I can still fucking see you, Mini-Me!  Let\\'s go. Hurry the fuck up. Let\\'s go.  The Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band.  Hold on to this for the second set.  He\\'s dumb but he\\'s not stupid.  At the end of the day, he wants a career, as dumb as he is.  Fudd has a chance of getting put back in, so why would he jeopardise that?  - I need to look at the music. - It\\'s right here.  - Why isn\\'t it on you? - Where\\'s the folder?  - You\\'re joking. You\\'re fucking around? - No...  I swear I had it here two seconds ago. It\\'s gotta be around here.  - Did you see...? - How could you be so stupid?  - I know. Maybe a janitor came by. - A janitor?  Find the fucking folder! A fucking janitor?  You\\'re a dumb fuck! A dumb fuck!  - Find the folder! - Okay, I\\'m sorry.  Tanned  Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been?  - We have an issue. - Okay, now is not the time.  I gave Neiman the folder and Neiman lost it.  - Neiman lost it. - Yes, sir.  The folder was your responsibility.  Why would you give it to Neiman? Right?  Give a calculator to a retard, he\\'s gonna turn on a TV with it.  - Get your sticks, get your ass on-stage. - I... I can\\'t.  You can\\'t?  I... I can\\'t go on-stag',\n",
       "  'e. I don\\'t know the charts by heart.  - Are you fucking kidding me? - I... You know this.  I need the music. It\\'s my memory, I need visual cues.  - Visual cues. - Yes. It\\'s a medical...  A medical condition? What, are you Sanjay Gupta?  Play the goddamn music.  - I can\\'t. - I can.  - You know \"Whiplash\" by heart? - Yes. Every measure.  All right. Well, you better fucking hope your memory doesn\\'t fail you.  I hope you play it a lot better than you did last month.  I do not intend to start losing.  Get your sticks and get your ass on-stage. On-stage!  And in first place...  \"Shaffer Conservatory\".  Hey. Don\\'t fucking touch my folder, man.  Do not touch this kit.  All right, let\\'s get to work, ladies.  Tanner, what you doing? It\\'s core only. I don\\'t have time for alternates.  \"Cherokee.\" From the top.  Tanner, are you a fucking statue? Let\\'s go. Get off the stool.  Don\\'t forget to turn Neiman\\'s pages. Here we go.  One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four.  What did you do to your hand?  - Is that from drumming? - Yeah. It\\'s nothing.  So how\\'s it going with the Studio Band?  Good.  Yeah, I think he likes me more now.  And his opinion means a lot to you, doesn\\'t it?  Yeah.  Wanna grab the shakers?  Jimbo? Overcooked.  You can barely chew this.  - He just laughs. - So how\\'s the drumming going, Andy?  Yeah, it\\'s going really well. I\\'m the new core drummer, so...  - Hey. - Congratulations.  Tom Brady.  - Did you hear, Jim? - No, what?  - Trav got named this year\\'s MVP. - That\\'s fantastic, Travis.  Yeah, and Dustin is heading up Model UN...  ...soon to be Rhodes Scholar and who knows what else.  And Jim, teacher of the year.  - Well, hey, listen... - I mean, come on.  The talent at this table, that is stunning.  - And Andy, with your drumming. - It\\'s going okay, Andy?  Yeah, it\\'s going really, really well, actually.  I\\'m part of Shaffer\\'s top jazz orchestra...  ...which means it\\'s the best in the country.  And I\\'m a core member...  ...so I\\'ll start playing in competitions. I just...  I found out I\\'m the youngest person in the band.  How do you know who wins in a music competition? Isn\\'t it subjective?  - No. - Does the studio get you a job?  It\\'s not an actual studio.  It\\'s the name of the ensemble, but it\\'s a big step forward in my career.  I\\'m so glad you figured it out. It\\'s a nasty business, I am sure.  Hey, are you gonna tell them about your game this week?  - Living up to your title. - I scored a 93-yard touchdown.  School record, school record.  - Is that true? That\\'s fantastic. - It\\'s Division Three.  It\\'s Carlton football. It\\'s not even Division Two, it\\'s Division Three.  - You got any friends, Andy? - No.  - Oh, why is that? - I don\\'t know. I never saw the use.  Who are you gonna play with otherwise? Lennon and McCartney were buddies.  Charlie Parker didn\\'t know anybody till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.  That\\'s your idea of success?  Being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody\\'s idea of success.  Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin...  ...at the age of 34 is not my idea of success.  I\\'d rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people talk about me...  ...than live to be rich and sober at go and nobody remember who I was.  But your friends will remember you, that\\'s the point.  None of us were friends with Charlie Parker. That\\'s the point.  Travis and Dustin, they ha',\n",
       "  've plenty of friends and plenty of purpose.  They\\'ll make great school board presidents.  You think you\\'re better than us?  - Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN? - I got a reply for you.  You think Carlton football is a joke? Come play with us.  Four words you will never hear from the NFL.  - Who wants dessert? - Heard from Lincoln Center?  Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new chart by the door on your way out.  Rehearsal 9 p. m. sharp tonight. That\\'s how long you have to learn it.  Neiman. Stick around a minute.  See the tempo marking on there?  \"Quarter note equals 330.\"  That is a double-time swing.  - That\\'s what got you in here, right? - Oh, yeah.  As fate would have it, I recently stumbled across another kid...  ...in the practice room working on his double-time swing.  So I\\'m gonna give him a shot.  - Am I late? - Perfect timing.  Come on in, Connolly.  - You two know each other, right? - Yeah, Nassau band.  What\\'s up, Andrew?  I\\'ve made Neiman a temporary core, but with this competition coming up...  ...I just wanna make very sure this chart is in the best shape it can be.  Yeah, this one right here, right?  I gave Connolly the chart this morning.  All I wanna do is give you both a crack at it, all right?  So, Neiman, go ahead, jump on the kit, take it from the top.  Okay.  I don\\'t want you to worry about hits now. Just tempo, okay?  All set?  One, two...  Not quite my tempo. Connolly.  - I can take it from the top. - Connolly, go ahead.  - I can do... - No. We\\'ll go with Connolly now.  Hey, do you mind?  Okay, man, ready?  One and two and...  - Perfect, Connolly. - Oh, my God.  See, this to me is the beauty of Studio Band.  You walk in here an alternate, you could be the new core.  - Oh, my God, are you serious? - Thanks.  That shit?  Fletcher.  Thanks, man. Here you go.  Don\\'t worry about Fletcher. He\\'s more bark than bite.  Hey, look, you... I can play these charts.  - Now is not the time, I swear to God. - I can play it, okay?  I said not now! If you want the fucking part, earn it.  I\\'m just gonna lay it out there.  This is why I don\\'t think we should be together.  And I\\'ve thought about it a lot, and this is what\\'s gonna happen.  I\\'m gonna keep pursuing what I\\'m pursuing.  Because I\\'m doing that, it\\'s gonna take up my time.  I\\'m not gonna be able to spend time with you.  Even when I do, I\\'m gonna be thinking about drumming.  About jazz, my charts. Because of that, you\\'re gonna start to resent me.  You\\'re gonna tell me to ease up on the drumming, spend more time with you.  I\\'m not gonna be able to do that. I\\'ll start to resent you for even asking me to stop.  We\\'re just gonna start to hate each other. It\\'s gonna be ugly.  And so for those reasons...  ...I\\'d rather just, you know, break it off clean.  Because I wanna be great.  And you\\'re not?  I wanna be one of the greats.  And I would stop you from doing that?  Yeah.  You know I would stop you from doing that?  You know that for a fact?  Yes.  And I\\'d barely see you anyway?  - Yeah. - I see you, you\\'d treat me like shit...  ...because I\\'m some girl who doesn\\'t know what she wants.  You have a path, you\\'re going to be great, I\\'m gonna be forgotten...  ...and you won\\'t be able to give me the time of day...  ...because you have bigger things to pursue.  That\\'s exactly my point.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You\\'re right. We sho',\n",

Guys, just put your instruments down for a minute.  Just listen for a minute.  Six years ago...  ...I came across a kid in a practice room working on his scales.  He was early second year and he\\'d started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.  Like all you guys.  But the truth was that he barely squeaked in to begin with...  ...and he was really struggling.  The faculty were all telling him, \"Maybe this isn\\'t for you.\"  But they didn\\'t see what I saw.  This scared, skinny kid...  ...cursing himself because he couldn\\'t get his scales right.  I saw a drive in him.  And I put him in Studio Band.  And when he graduated...  ...Marsalis made him third trumpet at Lincoln Center.  A year later, he was first.  That\\'s who you\\'re listening to now.  His name was Sean Casey.  I found out this morning...  ...that Sean...  ...died yesterday...  ...in a car accident.  And I just...  I wanted you guys to know he was a beautiful player.  I just thought you should know.  I\\'m sorry.  Okay.  Let\\'s get to work, huh? How about \"Caravan,\" bar 105?  Two bars for free.  One and two and...  It\\'s not quite right, Connolly.  I\\'d like to try Neiman on this.  Maybe now\\'s the time for Neiman to earn the part.  One and two and...  Nope, I guess not. Tanner?  One and two and...  Motherfucker!  Connolly, get your ass back on the kit.  We will stay here for as long as it takes until one of you faggots can play in time.  One and two and...  Looks like that might be all night. Neiman.  One and two and...  Not my fucking tempo!  Sorry, guys. Hate to put you through this.  If you need to fucking take a dump or get a coffee...  ...whatever, now might be a good time.  We\\'re gonna stay until I find a drummer who can fucking play in time.  I apologise to the musicians.  Seriously, take 10, 20, a fucking hour.  You hear me, cocksuckers? Better start shitting me perfect 400s.  Connolly, get your fucking ass back on the kit.  Is that really the fastest you can play, you worthless Hymie fuck?  No wonder Mommy ran out on you. Get off the fucking kit.  And here comes Mr. Gay Pride of the Upper West Side himself.  This is not a Bette Midler concert. We will not be serving baked Alaska...  ...so just play faster than you give hand jobs, will you?  One, two, one, two.  Not even fucking close.  Let\\'s go with the Irish Mick Paddy cracker now.  You know, you actually do look quite a bit like a leprechaun.  I\\'m gonna start calling you Flannery.  Get off!  What are you looking for? There\\'s no gold down there.  Adjusting the seat? Really?  That\\'s been your problem the whole time? The seat height?  So now you have it, right?  Go.  Bullshit! Fuck you!  Neiman.  Maybe it\\'s time...  ...to finally bring this home. What do you say?  Show me.  Don\\'t slow down.  Pick it up.  Faster!  Faster!  Faster!  Faster!  Faster!  Keep playing!  Keep playing! Keep playing! Keep playing!  Don\\'t stop.  Neiman...  ...you earned the part.  Alternates, you wanna clean the blood off my drum set?  Okay, we can start now.  5 p. m. call tomorrow in Dunellen.

I'm right there.  - We 're on-stage in 20. - I know.  - Fletcher's got Connolly warming up. - God fucking da... Okay.  You just tell that little fucking redhead I'll... I'm gonna be there, okay?

What the fuck did you say to me?  It's my part.  It's my part and I decide who to lend it to.  Usually it's somebody that has fucking sticks.  I left them in the car. I'll be right back. Five minutes.  I'm warming up the band now.  - I can use Ryan's sticks. - Neiman, you lost the fucking part.  No, I didn't. You can't do this.  - Can't? - Yeah.  When did you become a fucking expert on what I can do...  - ...you fucking weepy-willow shit sack? - I earned that part.  You never earned anything. You are a self-righteous prick.  The only reason you're a fucking core is because you misplaced a folder.  Only reason you're in Studio Band to begin with is because I told you...  ...what I'd be asking for in Nassau.  - Am I wrong? - Yeah.  - I'm in Studio Band because I'm the... - Back off.  Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah. Turn my pages, bitch.  Hey. I can cut you any fucking time I want.  - You would've cut me by now. - Try me, you fucking weasel.  At 5:30, that's in exactly 11 minutes, my band is on-stage.  If your ass is not on that stool with your own sticks in hand...  ...or if you make one fucking mistake...  ...one, I will drum your ass back to Nassau...  ...where you can turn pages until you graduate or fucking drop out.  By the time you're done at Shaffer, you'll make Daddy look like a success story.  Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah play the part.  - You choose. - That's my part. I'll be on your stage.  - Fuck you. - You got 10 minutes...  ...you fucking pathetic, pansy-ass fruit fuck.  - Tell Fletcher I'm coming. - What's taking you so long?  - We 're moving on-stage. - I got locked in my car. I'm coming.  Left turn, 200 feet.  - Are you driving, man? - No.  What the hell was that noise?  Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher that I'm coming, you motherfucker?  Hey. Hey, hey-  Are you okay? Are you okay?  - I gotta get my sticks. - No, stay away from the car.  - I've called 911. - Look, I gotta go.  - No, no, sir. - A couple more blocks.  - Sir, no, you don't have to... - Please get off me.  - Hey, guy. - What the fuck happened to you?

Last month, he hanged himself in his \",\n",
       "  'apartment.  - What does that have to do with me? - He suffered from anxiety, depression.  His mother claims this started during his time as Fletcher\\'s student.  Now, the Caseys aren\\'t wealthy, they don\\'t wanna file suit.  So, what do they want?  To make sure Terence Fletcher is never allowed to do this to another student.  Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.  Yeah, that\\'s my boy.  - He didn\\'t do anything. - What is wrong with you? It\\'s over, okay?  He\\'s out of your life. Why would you let him get away?  Would you characterise his conduct as extreme, Andrew?  Did he ever intentionally inflict emotional distress?  This would not be a public hearing, you know.  Fletcher would never know it was you who spoke up.  Why would you do this to me?  Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell...  ...and then just walk away scot-free?  Don\\'t you know I would never let that happen?  That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you?  Don\\'t you know that?  Andrew?  Andrew?  Just tell me what to say.  Hey.  I\\'d give anything to be there again this fall.  I like weddings, provided they\\'re not mine.  Marriages are very healthy.  Married men live much longer than bachelors.  They\\'re trying to outlive their wives so they can be bachelors again.  - Haven\\'t you thought of getting married? - I did.  The young lady changed her mind at the last moment.  I\\'ve been deeply indebted to her ever since.  And I loaded the pantry up with Gushers.  - Saw that. - Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Right on, man.  Andrew.  Hey.  I don\\'t know if you heard.  I\\'m not at Shaffer anymore.  Yeah, I did hear that.  Did you quit?  Not exactly.  Some parents got a kid from Sean Casey\\'s year, I think...  ...to say some things about me.  Although why anybody would have anything...  ...other than peaches and cream to say about me is a mystery.  Yeah.  - That\\'s a good laugh, right? - I\\'m sorry.  - No, listen... I get it. - I\\'m sorry.  I know I made enemies.  I\\'m conducting a little, though.  They brought back the JVC Fest this year.  They got me opening in a couple of weeks with a pro band.  That\\'s great.  Yeah. It\\'s all right.  Truth is, I don\\'t think people understood...  ...what it was I was doing at Shaffer.  I wasn\\'t there to conduct.  Any fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo.  I was there to push people beyond what\\'s expected of them.  I believe that is...  ...an absolute necessity.  Otherwise, we\\'re depriving the world of the next Louis Armstrong.  The next Charlie Parker.  I told you about how Charlie Parker became Charlie Parker, right?  - Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head. - Exactly.  Parker\\'s a young kid, pretty good on the sax.  Gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up.  And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.  And he\\'s laughed off-stage.  Cries himself to sleep that night, but the next morning, what does he do?  He practises.  And he practises and he practises with one goal in mind...  ...never to be laughed at again.  And a year later, he goes back to the Reno and he steps up on that stage...  ...and plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard.  So imagine if Jones had just said:  \"Well, that\\'s okay, Charlie. That was all right. Good job.\"  And then Charlie thinks to himself, \"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job.\"  End of story.  No Bird.  That, to me, i',\n",
       "  's an absolute tragedy.  But that\\'s just what the world wants now.  People wonder why jazz is dying.  I tell you, man, and every Starbucks \"jazz\" album...  ...just proves my point, really.  There are no two words in the English language more harmful...  ...than \"good job.\"  But is there a line?  You know, maybe you go too far and you discourage the next Charlie Parker...  - ...from ever becoming Charlie Parker. - No, man, no.  Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged.  Yeah.  The truth is, Andrew...  ...I never really had a Charlie Parker.  But I tried.  I actually fucking tried.  And that\\'s more than most people ever do.  And I will never apologise for how I tried.  I\\'ll see you later.  Yeah.  Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea how you\\'re gonna take this...  ...but the band I\\'m leading for JVC, my drummer is not cutting it.  You understand what I\\'m saying?  No.  I\\'m using the Studio Band playlist.  You know, \"Caravan,\" \"Whiplash.\"  I need somebody who really knows those charts.  What about Ryan Connolly?  All Connolly ever was to me was incentive for you.  - Tanner? - Tanner switched to premed.  I guess he got discouraged.  Hey.  Take the weekend. Think about it.  - Hello? - Hey, Nicole, it\\'s Andrew.  - Hi. - Hey.  It\\'s been a while since I talked to you.  Look, I...  I\\'m really sorry about everything.  I know that\\'s not, you know, enough, but I\\'m just really sorry.  But anyway, I got... I actually have this show this weekend.  It\\'s a...  Like, a JVC thing. And I didn\\'t know if maybe you\\'d wanna go...  ...and we, you know, maybe get some, like, pizza afterwards...  ...and, like, complain about our schools again.  What is...? You said Jayvees?  No, it\\'s JVC.  It\\'s like a... It\\'s a jazz thing.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, I don\\'t know if I can come. I... I\\'ll have to check with my boyfriend.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I\\'ll check, but I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t really think he likes jazz music.  Yeah, I mean, it\\'s not for everybody.  Okay. Well, I guess maybe I\\'ll see you guys there.  - Okay. - Okay.  Bye.  All right, gang, listen up. Now, for those of you who are new at this...  ...which looks like everybody except Cal, tonight could change your life.  The folks out there make a phone call, you could be a Blue Note signee...  ...an EMC client, a Lincoln Center core.  On the other hand...  ...if you drop the ball, you might be looking for a new line of work...  ...because the other thing about these cats is they never forget.  We all set?  All right. Let\\'s have fun.  You think I\\'m fucking stupid?  - What? - I know it was you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  We\\'re very excited to be here kicking off the JVC Festival this year.  I\\'m Terence Fletcher, these are some of the best musicians in New York...  ...which means they\\'re some of the best musicians in the world.  We\\'re gonna do some old standards, but we\\'re gonna start with a new tune...  ...by Tim Simonec called \"Upswingin\\'.\"  What the fuck you doing?  Come on, man.  Yeah, I guess maybe you don\\'t have it.  That was a little extra avant-garde there from the rhythm section.  Come on, let\\'s go home.  What are you doing?  Now we\\'re gonna slow it down a little bit.  I\\'m guessing most of you folks have heard...  I\\'ll cue you in.  \"Caravan.\"  Three, four.  I\\'m gonna gouge out your motherfucking eyes.  - Andrew, what are you doing, man? - I\\'ll cu'],\n",

Swivel on it, ya bum!  Hey, you know, when l was your age  there was one girl in the neighbourhood who talked like that, you know? Just one.  What you doin'? That'll make your teeth yellow.  - l like yellow teeth. - And your breath like garbage.  - Maybe l like garbage. - C'mon, nobody likes garbage.  Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking, but guys never took her serious, you see?  - They never took her out for a date. - Why?  Guys laugh when you talk dirty. They think you're cute.  lf you get a reputation, you get no respect, you understand?  You get no respect. l gotta use a bad word.  Whore. You understand? Whore.  You see, if you use dirty words, you maybe end up becomin' a whore.  - Come on, Rocky. l'm 1 2. - Hey, that don't matter you're 1 2.  You don't really have to be one.

That's when l started fightin'.  - Skating's bad for the ankles, you know? - Yeah.  You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?  Like l was sayin' on the way over, fightin' used to be tops with me, but no more.  All l wanted to do was prove l was no bum,  that l had the stuff to make a good pro.  - You never got the chance? - l ain't cryin', cos l still fight.  l kinda do it like a hobby. The trouble is, l'm a southpaw.  - What's a southpaw? - lt means you're left-handed.  A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?  Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward. Nobody wants to look awkward.  - You know where southpaw came from? - Nine minutes!  A long time ago, a couple of hundred years ago, this guy was fightin'.  l think it was around Philadelphia. He was left-handed.  His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.  And that's south, so they called him Southpaw.  You see? Southpaw, South Jersey,  South Camden, Southpaw... You know what l mean?  Things worked out for the best.  You never got a chance, being left-handed?  Well, that's absolutely true, you know? Watch out, watch out.  l just dislocated my finger. Agh! Look at that.  No, hey, wait! lt ain't your fault. Look.  See? Look. lt's an old wound. You see that?  Look. See? Nothin'. lt bends like that. l originally done it...  Push the button... Bong! lt works.  - lt ain't your fault. l'll show you... - Seven minutes!  l originally done it... l keep pictures of all my fights.  l done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?  He's the size of an airplane. l broke both my hands.  l lost that fight, but that's a nice picture, don't you think? See how it works there?  Come on. Are you havin' a good time?  l'll tell ya, you can see l ain't too graceful. l don't move well.  But l can really swat, you know? l can really hit hard.  But l'm a southpa\",\n",
       "  \"w and nobody wants to fight a southpaw, you know what l mean?  Whooo! You know how l got started in fightin'?  - Huh? - No.  Am l talkin' too loud?  - No. - Three minutes!  My father, he's... My old man, he was never too smart.  He says to me ''You weren't born much of a brain, so start usin' your body.''  So l've become a fighter.  You know what l mean? Why are you laughin'?  My mother, she said the opposite thing.  What did she say? What did she say, the opposite?  ''You weren't born much of a body, so you'd better develop your brain.''  - Did she say that? - Yo! Time!  - Can l ask you a question? - Absolutely.  - Why do you wanna fight? - Cos l can't sing or dance.  Hey, yo!  Don't fall! Don't fall!  Hey, that was terrific. l'm good at this.

You know, some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me none.  lt don't bother me, either.  Why did l bother bringin' it up? Cos l'm dumb, that's why.  l think we make a real sharp couple of coconuts. l'm dumb, you're shy.  l don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter.  Hey, you gotta be a moron.  You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what l mean?  lt's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.  - l don't think you're a bum. - l'm at least half a bum, you know?  l'll tell ya somethin'.  The worst thing about fightin' is the mornin' after, you know?  l'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're nothin' but a large wound, you know?  Sometimes l got pains all over me.  l wanna call a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom.  Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face is all busted up, your hands is swollen.  Look at this face. 64 fights. Look at that nose. See that nose?  That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights.  l've had guys bustin' on it, chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it.  l mean, whack, boom. These guys are hittin' my nose all the time.  Never broke. l'm proud of that. Ain't that rare? That's rare.  - Why do you do it if it hurts? - Why you think?  - Cos you can't sing or dance? - Yeah, somethin' like that.

Well, it's just that, you see, l fight in clubs, you know?  l'm really a ham and egger. This guy is the best. lt wouldn't be such a good fight.  But thank you very much, you know? l appreciate it.  Rocky, do you believe that America is the land of opportunity?  Yeah.  Apollo Creed does.  And he's gonna prove it to the world by giving an unknown a shot at the title.  And that unknown is you.  He picked you, Rocky.  Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.  You can't pass it by.  What do ya say?  All right. That's enough pictures. We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.  How do you like the city of brotherly love?  Well, just bein' in Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic.  Beautiful people in a beautiful city wishin' me the best.  l love my Philadelphia brothers. l'm proud to be an American.  Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning?  Look, if history proves one thing...  American history proves that everybody's got a chance to win.  Didn't you guys ever hear of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?  lt is a coincidence that you're fighting a white man  on the most celebrated day in US history?  l don't know. ls it a coincidence that he's fightin' a black man on the same day?  Right on! Tell the truth, brother!  How do you feel about your challenger?  How do l feel about him? Come here, Rock.  - My main man. Rocky, ain't you ltalian? - Yeah, l'm ltalian.  - Well now, what does that mean? - lf he can't fight, l bet he can cook!  - Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out. - Paulie!  Rocky, how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?  Well, jeez, Creed's the best. l guess l'll have to do the best l can.  Tell me, Rocky. Just between us,  where did you get the name ''ltalian Stallion''?  Oh, l invented that about eight years ago when l was eatin' dinner.  Rocky, now your payday will be $1 50,000. Any comment?  - You got no comment, Rocky, right? - No.  No comment, right.  Wait a minute. l just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, OK?  Yo, Adrian! lt's me, Rocky. Look at this. Can you believe all this?  Rocky, you didn't...!  - Thank you, Rocky. - Quit pushin', man!  Thank you, Rocky.  Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool? l'd break his lips.  - He's takin' cheap shots. - lt don't bother me none.  Yo, Rock. l guess you'd be lookin' for people to help you out.  - Help what? - You know...  - Keep you livin' a clean life. - l do OK, you know?  You need someone to help with the exercise, stand by with a towel,  run errands.  Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody. l think l'm gonna train myself, you know?  Without such good people around to help, you don't have such a good chance.  Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.  - That so? - Yeah.  Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was blind. l think Rocky's got a good chance.  - Want me to get you a beer, Paulie? - You lookin' to do a good deed?  Keep outta my freakin' life!  - What did l do? - Nothin'.  - Did l say something? - You didn't say nothin'.  That's right, you didn't say nothin'! Nothin' at all!  l gotta go.

Look at all this blood.  Mister, what happened to you?  Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am, building 8.  Please take care of him.  - Thank you. - Not at all.  Well, then...  Farewell, Oh Dae-su.  Farewell, Oh Dae-su.  Farewell...  A bastard you hate but wouldn\\'t want to kill.  A bitch you detest but want more than to kill.  We\\'ll take care of them.  Don\\'t they go mad being locked up for so long?  If you prefer that he doesn\\'t we can administer some medication.  There\\'s this one called “Risperdal Solution“.  It\\'s known to be a reliable treatment for schizophrenia.  The duration is always the issue.  - How long are you thinking of...? - 15 years.  - Too long? - What did he do wrong?  Oh Dae-su, you see,  talks too much.  Go to sleep.  It\\'s about time you visited Joo-hwan\\'s Internet cafe tomorrow.  Sit wherever you\\'d like.  Joo-hwan.  Oh Dae-su, you see,  talks too much.  Have you heard this voice before?  Do you know anyone who would hate me this much?  I don\\'t know all the 260 names of your women\\'s husbands.  \"Mi-do (Princess Sashimi)\"  - Who\\'s Mi-do? - This girl who cries over nothing.  Joo-hwan.  Did I really talk that much?  Doe-su, the way I see it you should look for the perpetrator  among those who used to be in your close proximity.  \"Search for friends: Evergreen\"  “Over 50 search results.“  \"Evergreen invites you to be online friends.\"  \"As of yesterday statute of limitations has expired for Oh Dae-su.\"  But please remember. Open quote.  Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter  Like a bird from the snare of the fowler  Free yourself.  - Close quote. - Who are you?  Who are you, you rotten bastard?  I had decided while I was locked up,  that I wouldn\\'t trust anyone if I get out.  That if I find anyone to be suspicious  I would create a secret which only that person and I will know.  The messenger ID, \\'Monster\\' is a trap that I made to catch you.  You bring a complete stronger home. Who are you?  Who is Evergreen?  I tracked down that ID, Evergreen, and found out the personal details.  - Ready to jot it down? - Go ahead  The name is Su Dee-ah. Ever heard that surname, \\'Su\\'?  - Address? - It\\'s in Eung-am.  Saewoon Apartments Building 7, unit 407.  I\\'m not doing fine in this life in a bigger prison.  \"Evergreen.\"  \"Who are you?\"  You were going to say that, right?  No, you must find out on your own. Come on, it\\'s a game.  First, who? Then, why?  Once you solve the questions come see me anytime.  I\\'ll mark the answers for you. You have until July 5th.  Only five days left.  Too short?  Do your best. If you pass I\\'ll kill myself instead of Mi-do.  That\\'s right, Mi-do.  I\\'m going to kill every woman you love until you die. ',\n",
       "  ' You\\'re notorious for not being able to protect your women.  Wow, you\\'re strong, Mr. Monster.  You truly are the monster of my creation.  But this way, you won\\'t ever find out the \"why?\"  The question that bugged you for the last 15 years.  You don\\'t care anymore?  Take that seat.  Ah, the dental torture.  You won\\'t get enough time to torture me.  I have a weak heart so I have this motor inside.  When it was put in do you know what I said to the doctor?  Doctor Hopkins  gave me a remote control that can switch the motor off.  Pardon? Why?  So I can kill myself easily any time I want.  I\\'ll give you a 100 grand more.  Oh, what a conundrum.  You wan\\'t to kill me right away,  but you won\\'t find out why you were locked up.  You want to torture me but I say I\\'ll kill myself first.  To get your revenge or to find out the reason.  Oh, that is the big question.  I\\'ve been watching you for 15 years.  I fared well thanks to you. I wasn\\'t bored or lonely.  Seeking revenge is the best cure for the ones who were hurt.  Try it.  The loss of 15 years.  The pain of losing your wife and child. All these would go away.  In other words vengeance is healthy.  But what happens after you\\'ve fulfilled your vengeance?  I bet that hidden pain will probably come back again.  \"Are you there Mr. Oh Dae-su?\"  \"Mr. Oh Dae-su long time no see.\"  Hasn\\'t she been tied up for too long? I think you also left the door open.  Please save me.  I need saving myself.  Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose.  This dentist is really good.  Don\\'t move.  What\\'s with you?  Now  here we go.  You know, they say that cowardice comes from imagination.  So try not to imagine.  It\\'ll make you fucking brave.  Now, here comes the real thing.  Yes?  Well, sir, I do thank you for telling me about this place,  but I haven\\'t even started.  What?  Let\\'s go.  Let\\'s really go.  Let\\'s fight.  Let\\'s fight.  Tenacious.  Your hand.  I\\'m going to cut off your hand. You touched Mi-do\\'s breasts.  Then what about my tongue?  You still don\\'t trust me you rotten bastard?  I don\\'t think we\\'ll reach an agreement  I looked into it  and their reason for not paying more than 270 million  wasn\\'t to do with the evaluation of this building.  It\\'s likely that their convertible bonds holders are...  So I think there won\\'t be a big issue.  Of course, there\\'s the 25 percent stake held by their chairman and his relatives.  Dae-su.  Yeah.  Did he really say that he\\'ll kill me?  Yeah.  Because I am a woman you love?  Dae-su.  What?  I wonder where my love is.  The night is getting lonelier.  The words we spoke with our eyes  can be felt with these hands  Countless nights may pass  but my heart is turned to you.  Though I may shed my sad tears  it\\'s still your face that I miss  They packed up and left in a rental car.  Mi-do called the restaurant and quit.  Let\\'s go after this is done.  You should get some rest today.  I have insomnia anyway. \"The night is getting lonelier.\"  Mr. Han, do you really think  Mi-do has fallen in love with Oh Dae-su?  Already?  Dae-su, it really hurts.  But I\\'m enduring it.  I want you to know that.  How did you hold out? For 15 years?  There\\'s always a way.  Do you like it?  You really like it',\n",
       "  ', right? I want to be good to you.  Do not worry about the future.  Don\\'t imagine anything.  I feel thankful for all those years in that prison.  If I was still my old self would Mi-do have liked me like this?  The fact that he knew I wanted to cut off Park\\'s hand means  he\\'s planted a bug on us.  He knew where we were by tailing us.  \"I\\'ve been bugged. Please find it.\"  Maybe, he let you go,  because he has fun watching you run wild seeking revenge.  Never telling you why, toying with you forever.  Could that be it?  Evergreen Press Online Printing System.  Evergreen Pasta and Pizza.

Evergreen Secret Diary Jung Sang-rok\\'s personal site.  Norwegian Wood, Evergreen...  \"Welcome to Evergreen Old Boys,  the Sangnok High School Alumni Homepage.“  But it\\'s time to close up.  Can\\'t I look at the records of Class \\'79?  It\\'s dark so turn on the lights.  Take your time.  Joo-hwan? Let me ask you something.  Do you know Lee Woo-jin of Class \\'79?  I think he went to America to study.  Lee Woo-fin?  Don\\'t know him. Is that his name? How did you find out?  Looked through all the yearbooks and found his face.  I wouldn\\'t know him just by his name.  \"Scissorhands Hair Salon.\"  Got anything else? Like the school records?  Do you know Lee Soo-ah? She was in our year.  - Lee Soo-ah? She died. - What class was she in?  Homeroom two. She was in my class  next to yours. What about her?  But why is there  no photo, because she was dead. How did Soo-ah die?  That\\'s right, you wouldn\\'t know. She died after you transferred.  She went alone to the Habchun Dam, fell into the river and drowned.  A week later they found her bloated body in the water.  - What was she like? - Her?  She was a total slut.  Acting like a prude on the outside but a filthy whore on the inside.  There was a huge rumor at the school that she fucked anyone and everyone.  I should\\'ve gotten in there.  Anyway, her family was super rich. Her grades were really good, too.  But the crucial thing was that she was such a slut.  This is such an old story.  Dae-su, I don\\'t remember tfoo well since it was so long ago.  But that Soo-ah... Wait, didn\\'t you also...?  Hey, what\\'s going on? Joo-hwan!  Joo-hwan what\\'s happening?  Joo-hwan!  Mr. Oh Dae-su?  My sister wasn\\'t a slut.  I really want you to know that.  Because you got rid of all the bugs I had to come all the way here.  To listen in.  So, Mr. Roh Joo-hwan  died because of you. Okay?  You son of a bitch! I\\'m going to kill you!  I am going to rip you into little pieces!  Motherfucker!  We\\'re not open yet. Please come back in an hour.  A man who got six gold teeth here recommended this place.  Mr. Park?  I had to move because of you.  To celebrate  I bought some new TVs. Do you like it?  There are so many channels. Exciting, huh?  Some of them even refuse to leave.  You lived in a place like this for 15 years?  Got used to it after 11 years.  Come on, I don\\'t need money.  An enemy\\'s enemy is a friend.  We threw away the hand because it rotted.  My wife will be happy...  Damn sons of bitches I want to kick their asses.',\n",
       "  '  So why did you bring me here?  Let me go!  If I don\\'t return after July 5th then let her go.  While I was locked up I remember someone visiting me.  - What did that person do? - Was it three times?  I put a hypnosis-inducing drug in your water.  Sodium Barbiturate?  TV Man knows if all.  Dae-su!  “Scissorhands Hair Solon.“  That\\'s nonsense.  Even though it was a Catholic school,  I doubt she killed herself because of those rumors.  There probably was another reason.  Like she got pregnant or something.  But I don\\'t think Soo-ah really was a slut.  She was such a neat and tidy girl.  She wouldn\\'t put out for just anyone.  There must have been a guy she was going out with.  So who was that guy?  Well, I wouldn\\'t know.  Choon-shim. You knew Lee Soo-ah, right?  Who was her boyfriend?  Don\\'t know?  Shut the hell up.  What would you know about friendship?  Shut your trap. Then who\\'d know?  Who? Joo-hwan?  What?  Yeah, I know him. But how would he know?  Yeah. Really?  Okay, hang up. I\\'ll call you in a bit.  Choon-shim says Joo-hwan had told her about it.  And says that you would know the best.  Ring, ring, move aside.  You\\'ll get hurt if you hesitate.  \"Oh Dae-su\"  Look at you. Put it out!  I\\'m transferring today to Seoul.  So butt out, Miss Kim.  You good-for-nothing!  - You\\'re Oh Dae-su, right? - And you\\'re Miss...?  I heard you\\'re popular among the girls.  You know how rumors are.  I heard you\\'re really funny. Say something funny.  Being stuck with one image isn\\'t healthy, but...  There\\'s this father and son. They went to the public bath...  See you later.  \"Take Care Homeroom Three Fuckheads!\"  - Come on. - Wait.  - Come here. - No.  - Hurry and come here. - Okay, okay.  Satisfied?  - Raise this up. - No way.  - Raise it. - No.  What?  It tickles.  Give it here.  What are you doing?  - Let me see. - See what?  - Let me see. - Stop.  Go away.  Was it really Soo-ah? You sure?  I don\\'t know her name.  All I know is that she\\'s in your class and she rides a red bike.  Have a good trip. See you in Seoul if I go.  - Where are you going? - Going on a date with Choon-shim.  You\\'re dead meat if you tell anyone!  No way.  You get locked up for 15 years just for saying that?  Was that such a big sin?  Be it a grain of sand or a rock in water they sink the same.  That\\'s what Lee Woo-jin believes.  Then what\\'s special about July 5th?  That\\'s the day  Lee Soo-ah died.  It\\'s over then.  You said it\\'s not about vengeance but finding out why he locked you up.  Now we\\'ll run away where he can never find us, right?  I can\\'t end it like this.  Vengeance has now become a part of me.  But you don\\'t even know where he lives.  Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter  Like a bird from the snare of the fowler  Free yourself.  It\\'s from The Proverbs chapter 6 verse 4. “Proverbs“ is another word for “Maxim“.  And Evergreen said he lives in a high tower.  So chapter 6 verse 4 must mean the floor numbers.  Fourth floor? Sixth floor?  Or the sixty-fourth floor?  P?  Penthouse!  Please press the passcode.  What would you like me to pray for?  Wrong entry. Please press again.  Wrong entry. Please press again.  \"Dear Lord,  please let me meet a younger man next time.\"  Please make Le',\n",
       "  'e Woo-jin kneel down to Dae-su  and beg him for mercy.  You slept with your sister.  Let\\'s go up and talk.  Get him!  Let\\'s talk it out.  Feels great.  You slept with your sister.  So refreshing.  And I started the rumors. That\\'s why your sister died.  Looking through the mirror reminds me of that day. Same for you?  How unfair of you to erase my memory and then to tell me to find it.  I won, so  die like you promised.  You think you couldn\\'t remember that day because you were hypnotized? Really?  Do you know the real reason why you couldn\\'t remember?  Let me tell you.  You just forgot.  Is that a letdown?  But it\\'s true you simply forgot.  Why? Because it wasn\\'t your business.  Your rumor grew to the point where they were saying Soo-ah got pregnant.  My sister got sucked into that rumor and in the end, began to believe it.  Then, her period actually stopped and her belly began to swell.  Amazing, isn\\'t it?  Ever thought about the girl, pregnant with a child who\\'s also her nephew?  Understand now?  Your tongue got my sister pregnant.  It wasn\\'t Lee Woo-jin\\'s dick.  It was Oh Dae-su\\'s tongue.  Is that why you killed your sister?  I thought about the boy, about to father a child who\\'s also his nephew.  You were probably afraid.  Afraid that everyone will find out once the baby\\'s born.  When you realized that it was all just her imagination after you killed her -  how you must have hated me.  It\\'s understandable.  They say Soo-ah died alone at the dam but who took this photo?  What about this date, July 5th?  This is no fun.  I\\'ll just finish what I was telling you. Listen carefully. My story is really fun.  Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion?  You suggest something during hypnosis  and then it\\'s acted out in your awakened state.  Still haven\\'t figured if out?  You bring a complete stranger home who are you?  Who are you, you rotten bastard?  We hypnotized you both.  One very fortunate thing was that you both were  highly receptive to hypnosis compared to average people.  Isn\\'t this fun?  One word gets you pregnant, one word gets you in love.  But no matter how much you two are receptive to hypnosis  or no matter how good a hypnotist Ms. Yoo is,  getting people to fall in love isn\\'t easy.  So do you know what we did?  - Oh that? - Your first suggestion, of course,  was to go to that restaurant as soon as you were released.  Next, to react to the specific melody from the cell phone.  When you hear the melody you were to say certain words.  Who are you?  Do you like your clothes?  To the man who says those words Mi-do was to perform a certain action.  When she grabs your hand your reaction was to be, of course...  Your true mistake was not failing to find the answer.  You kept asking the wrong question so how could you find the right answer?  It\\'s not \"Why did Lee Woo-jin lock me up?\"  It\\'s \"Why did he let me go?\"  Once again,  why did Lee Woo-jin release Oh Dae-su after just  15 years?  “Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you will weep alone.“  Mr. Han.  Mister Han!  Mi-do...  Mi-do doesn\\'t know, right?  Why did you hide her there?  You thought he\\'d hate me because I cut off his hand?  Didn\\'t you stop to think maybe it was a trap?  How can',\n",
       "  ' you protect your woman with that brain of yours?  I\\'ve been secretly protecting Mi-do since she was three.  But what about you?  Mr. Park\\'s hand?  You imbecile.  Know that new prison of his? He said he had to move.  So I gave him that building in payment for his hand!  Dae-su!  There\\'s a box here.  It\\'s that some violet box. He\\'s telling me to open it.  No!  No, Mi-do, don\\'t.  Don\\'t open it no matter what.  If you open it something terrible will happen.  What\\'s in it? You know, don\\'t you?  Mi-do. My sweet pea wait a bit longer.  I\\'ll be there very soon.  Can\\'t you come right now? I\\'m scared.  My sweet pea, you can wait for me?  Yes.  Good. Good girl.  I\\'ll call you very soon, okay?  I beg you.  Please don\\'t tell Mi-do.  What has she done wrong?  You know it was all my fault.  I have...  I have committed a terrible sin to your sister.  And I was very wrong to you.  So please leave Mi-do alone, okay?  If Mi-do finds out the truth,  you asshole,  from the top of your head down to the tips of your toes,  no one will be able to find any trace of your body on this earth. Why?  Because I\\'m going to chew up every last piece of it.  Woo-jin!  Mr. Lee Woo-jin I made a mistake.  Please forget what I said.  Sir! Boss!  Woo-jin!  We\\'re Evergreen Old Boys remember?  With the energy from the green pine tree,  the Great Sangnok High...  I\\'ll do whatever you want.  I\\'ll do anything. I beg you.  Woo-jin, if you want me to be a dog, I will!  I\\'m Woo-jin\\'s dog from now on!  I\\'m your puppy!  Look, I\\'m wagging my tail.  I\\'m a dog.  I\\'ll guard your house. I\\'ll be your slave dog.  The box...  Just leave it closed.  Now,  what joy will I live for?  Dae-su.  It really hurts.  But I\\'m enduring it.  I want you to know that.  How did you hold out? For 15 years?  My sister and I knew everything but still loved each other.  Can you two do the same?  Dae-su. Do you like it?  I want to be good to you.  Soo-ah.  Woo-jin.  I know you\\'ve been scared.  So let go of me, okay?  Remember me, alright?  I have no regrets. Do you?  Up until this point is the whole story of my adventure.  Thank you gor listening to this terrible story to the end.  I hope you now understand me sending a letter  instead of talking to you in person. This is because I have no tongue.  To be honest I have no reason to help you.  But you see,  I was touched by this lust sentence.  \"Even though I\\'m no better than a beast,  don\\'t I have the right to live?“  But the hypnosis may go wrong and mess up your memories.  Will that be okay?  Once you\\'re ready,  stare at that tree.  The tree is slowly changing into a concrete pillar.  You\\'re now inside Lee Woo-Jin\\'s penthouse.  It\\'s a dreary night.  The sound of your footsteps to the window echoes through the room.  When I ring my bell,  you\\'ll be split into two persons.  The one who doesn\\'t know the secret is named \"Oh Dae-su.\"  The one who keeps the secret is named \"The Monster.\"  When I ring my bell again,  the Monster will turn around and begin walking.  With each step he will age by one year.  When the Monster reaches 70 he will die.  There\\'s no need to worry. It will be a very peaceful death.  Good luck.  What\\'s wrong?  Look at you.  Who were you with?  I love you,  Dae-s']]"
